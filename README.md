# HackerRank_SQL_Challenges
In this series, I will share solutions to some tricky and easy but essential challenges on HackerRank SQL prep (using MySQL). I will also share new functions as 'note'  that I learned while solving these challenges.

<br> HackerRank_SQL_1 covers the following functions/topics: regexp / rlike / not regexp / not rlike, like '%x' vs like 'x%', case, substr, round, ceil, left, union, row_number, with clause, window functions, joins with error 1055, sqrt,  and power.
